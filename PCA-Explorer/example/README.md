In the `target` file, `label` and `group` columns are mandatory. 

In the `label` column, please refrain from using any special characters, only `.` is acceptable `e.g. Sample.1`

The `label` column fields must match the column names of the `countMatrix.txt` file. <br> 
`e.g. Sample.1 label must have a corresponding Sample.1 counts column in the countMatrix.txt file`

All labels are case-sensitive.
